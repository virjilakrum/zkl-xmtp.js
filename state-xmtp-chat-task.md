# ZK-Lokomotive Project - Renaming Task State

## Task: Rename Project to ZK-Lokomotive

### What I was asked to do:
- Change the project name to "zk-lokomotive" everywhere in the codebase
- Previously: Run the XMTP chat project (completed)

### Findings:
- Project structure: This is a React application using XMTP protocol, now renamed to ZK-Lokomotive
- Main app is in `xmtp.chat/` directory (directory name unchanged)
- Built with: React 19, Vite, Mantine UI, XMTP browser SDK
- Dependencies: Uses workspace references suggesting this is part of a monorepo
- Available scripts: `yarn dev`, `yarn build`, `yarn typecheck`
- Original status: Project was successfully running before renaming task

### Problem solving approach for renaming:
1. Identify all instances where project name appears
2. Distinguish between app name (should change) vs XMTP protocol references (should not change)
3. Update package.json, README files, app branding
4. Update analytics domain and console logs  
5. Update welcome page title
6. Preserve all XMTP SDK and protocol references

### Files needed:
- `xmtp.chat/package.json` - Contains dependencies and scripts
- `xmtp.chat/vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- Node modules and dependencies

### Current Status: PROJECT SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING ✅

- ✅ Created state tracking file
